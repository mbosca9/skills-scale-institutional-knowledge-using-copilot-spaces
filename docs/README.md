# OctoAcme — Project Management Documentation

This folder collects OctoAcme's project-management guidance, processes, and supporting artifacts. The documents below describe how projects are initiated, planned, executed, tracked, released, and retrospectively improved at OctoAcme.

Project-management overview (brief):

- Initiation: Define business context, objectives, and initial scope to align stakeholders and create a lightweight project brief. See `./octoacme-project-initiation.md` for details.
- Planning: Translate the brief into an execution plan with milestones, deliverables, roles, and a risk register. See `./octoacme-project-planning.md`.
- Execution & tracking: Use a cadence of short, observable work increments, track progress against milestones, and maintain transparent status reporting. See `./octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md`.
- Release & deployment: Coordinate release activities, deployment checklists, and rollback plans to reduce release risk. See `./octoacme-release-and-deployment.md`.
- Risks & communication: Maintain an explicit risks log and a communication plan that surfaces impacts and decisions to stakeholders. See `./octoacme-risks-and-communication.md`.
- Roles & personas: Clarify responsibilities and decision authority for project roles (sponsors, product leads, delivery leads, and contributors). See `./octoacme-roles-and-personas.md`.
- Retrospective & continuous improvement: After each release or milestone, run structured retrospectives to capture actionable improvements and feed them back into planning. See `./octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md`.
